Create Your custom payment gateway for woocommerce in wordpress


If you want to create your custom payment gateway for some special users , like for some users having a specific role. Then it would be very helpful for you.

I created this for my client's special requirement. I need to create a special payment gateway for users having role business owner (wholesale_customer). So that the business users can place an order without making a payment , and get a bill in the last of the month.

You can just place the whole code in theme's functions.php , or you can create your custom plugin with this code.
